## About
I’m a Computer Science student focused on building **reliable backend systems** and **production-ready web applications**, with a strong interest in open-source engineering.

I value clean code, solid fundamentals, and understanding how systems behave in real-world conditions.  
Currently preparing for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and **Summer of Bitcoin (SoB)** through consistent learning and open-source contributions.

I’m also a **co-author of an IEEE Xplore research publication**, with experience in structured research, system design, and technical documentation.
