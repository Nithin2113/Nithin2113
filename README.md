## About Me

> Creative intro using Java syntax - because why not?

```java
public class Nithin {
    String name = "Nithin T";
    String location = "India";
    String[] skills = {"Java", "C++", "Python", "JavaScript", "DSA"};
    String currentFocus = "Building stuff & solving problems";
    String goal = "Software dev ";
    
    public String getFunFact() {
        return "I write bugs faster than I fix them";
    }
}
```

CS student who spends way too much time debugging code that worked yesterday. Currently grinding DSA and building full-stack apps. Planning to land an SDE role by 2026, but let's see if my code cooperates.

When I'm not staring at error messages, I'm exploring AI/ML and pretending I understand neural networks.

## What I'm Up To

**Data Structures & Algorithms**  
Learning the hard way that there's always a more optimal solution. Currently at 50+ problems solved, aiming for 300+.

**Full Stack Development**  
Building apps with React and Node.js. Still Googling "how to center a div" more often than I'd like to admit.

**AI & Machine Learning**  
Playing with TensorFlow and pretending my models aren't just fancy random number generators.

**System Design**  
Learning how real engineers build stuff that doesn't crash when more than 3 people use it.

---

## Goals

- Solve 300+ DSA problems without crying
- Build 5 full-stack projects that actually work
- Learn system design (and understand what a load balancer does)
- Land an SDE role by end of 2026
- Contribute to open source without breaking everything

Thanks for stopping by. Now back to debugging that infinite loop...
